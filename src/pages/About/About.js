        Hello, I'm Florencio but you can call me Flo
      </h1>
      <p className={styles.intro}>
        I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer based in NYC with a core focus on
        JavaScript. While JavaScript is my primary language, I am always eager
        to explore new languages. I am open to new opportunites and to work with
        you in the near future.
        <br />
        <br />
        I proudly served nine years in the United States Army where I developed
        the discipline and work ethic that I now bring to every project. From my
        early days as a Private learning to follow orders to my role as a
        Sergeant leading a team of soldiers, I've honed principles of
        leadership, dedication, and teamwork. Iâ€™m eager to apply these same
        principles in the tech field and look forward to the opportunity to work
        and grow together.
        <br />
        <br />
        Currently I am an undergrade at BMCC pursuing my Computer Science
        degree. In my downtime, I enjoy watching anime and make it a priority to
        stay active, sitting is the new smoking after all.
